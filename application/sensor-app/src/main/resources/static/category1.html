        <h1>Temperature Sensor</h1>
        <p>The LM35 sensor which has been used in measuring the temperature is a high-precision, integrated circuit temperature sensor whose output voltage is directly proportional to the Celsius (Centigrade) temperature. It operates over a temperature range of -55°C to +150°C and typically provides an output of 10 mV per degree Celsius.

Here are some aspects contributing to the quality of the LM35 sensor:

Accuracy: The LM35 sensor offers high accuracy, typically within ±0.5°C at room temperature. This level of accuracy is suitable for a wide range of applications where precise temperature measurement is required.

Linearity: It exhibits excellent linearity, meaning that the relationship between its output voltage and temperature is linear. This characteristic simplifies calibration and makes it easy to interface with microcontrollers or other devices.

Low self-heating: The LM35 has very low self-heating, which minimizes temperature errors caused by the sensor itself. This property is especially important in applications where the sensor is placed in environments with temperature gradients.

Low impedance output: The LM35 has a low impedance output, allowing it to drive long cables or be connected to high impedance input devices without significant signal degradation.

Ease of use: With its straightforward three-terminal design and linear output, the LM35 is easy to integrate into electronic circuits. It requires minimal external components and can be powered from a single supply voltage.

Robustness: The LM35 is built using robust semiconductor fabrication techniques, making it reliable and durable in various operating conditions. It can withstand mechanical stress and environmental factors to ensure long-term performance.

Cost-effectiveness: Despite its high performance, the LM35 is relatively inexpensive compared to other temperature sensors with similar accuracy and features. This makes it a cost-effective solution for a wide range of temperature sensing applications.</p>
