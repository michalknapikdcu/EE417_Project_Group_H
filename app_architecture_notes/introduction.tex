Unless someone else prefers to take lead, I, Micha≈Ç will 
use this document to at least kick-start the group project. Here are my limitations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Fully remote, in full employment, so this, Trello, and Whatsapp are the only ways of
            communicating with me.
    \item Not a native English speaker.
    \item No experience as Web Developer.
    \item I use LaTeX to write this document.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
If anyone volunteers to lead the project, I will happily follow orders.
