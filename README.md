# EE417 Project Group H

Project started. Currently: Michal needs to write a basic server that sends dummy JSON-sensor readings to the client, periodically.
Others: please take a look at app_architecture_notes/document.pdf and try to come-up with next steps. The sensors JSON need to be processed and visualised, 
we'll need authentication, etc.
